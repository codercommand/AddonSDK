# AddonSDK
version 2.2
requiers python 3.5 
(was made on 3.5.2, but anything thats 3.5+ should work)

This is a command line program for making minecraft behavior pack addons.

I'll be working to improve this thing so any ideas on what to fix
or what should be implumented next is welcome.

The zip compiler has just had a complete redo, meaning its a hole new
compiler. And the main file has had a little update to keep it compatiable 
with the ziper. So the AddonSDK is 1.2, but the ziper is 2.0, so
we are now officially at 2.2!

The new zipper purforms much better than the old one, I'm very happy with it.
