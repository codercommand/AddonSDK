# AddonSDK
version 1.1
requiers python 3.5 
(was made on 3.5.2, but anything thats 3.5+ should work)

This is a command line program for making minecraft behavior pack addons 

The Zip packer for packing addons is not believed to be the most stable, bugs with it are kinda known.

I'll be working to improve this thing so any ideas on what to fix
or what should be implumented next is welcome
