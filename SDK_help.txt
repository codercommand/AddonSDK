AddonSDK 1.1

The AddonSDK is a standard development kit
for making behavior addons

the SDK currently only supports the creation
of behavior packs

all the following file formats are supported:

json, txt, and png, anything else it wont pack


the SDK currently only has the following commands:

$ random 
random returns a random uuid for your projects

$ exit
this can be used to close the console instead of the exit button

$ make manifest
this is used to make a manifest for anyone that only
wants a manifest, the manifests already come with a random 
uuid, so no need to find one

$ make ziper
this can be used to make a ziper program, for if anyone wants to zip
a pack but never made it with the $ new <project name>
command

$ new <project name>
this is used to start a behavior addon pack,
it'll make the manifest, ziper, entities, and loot_tables
folder/files

$ update <project name>
this is used to change/update the manifest in an already made
project, when doing so it'll also make new uuids for the manifest
